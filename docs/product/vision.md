# Vision

## ✨ Product Vision

Family Meal Planner is a *private* Progressive Web Application (PWA) that helps our family plan dinner each week with minimal effort and minimal waste.

It empowers us to:
- Save favorite recipes from trusted websites into a personal recipe library
- Discover new recipe suggestions tailored to our preferences and what we already have
- Plan exactly **three dinners per week**
- Automatically generate a weekly shopping list
- Track what we *already have* in our fridge and pantry
- Reduce food waste by recommending meals that use existing ingredients

The app is built for **two adults and two children** (ages 4 & 9) — with simplicity, reliability, and low cognitive load.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Weekly meal planning should *add convenience* — not struggle:
- We want to stop scrabbling for recipe ideas
- Repeated grocery runs should be unnecessary
- Food shouldn’t go bad unused
- Recipes should fit our family’s breakfast & dinner rhythm (focus on dinner)

This tool is our personal master planner, getting smarter with use.

## 🎯 Success Outcomes

We know the product is working when:
1. We can easily import recipes via URL from a curated whitelist of trusted sources.
2. The system proposes weekly meal ideas based on:
   - Our favorites
   - Seasonal and family-friendly choices
   - What’s already in stock
3. We can select **3 meals**, and the app generates the needed shopping list.
4. Inventory is updated via shopping + fridge photos.
5. Our weekly grocery runs are shorter and more predictable.
6. We reduce food waste — **less leftover food** at the end of the week.

## 📦 MVP Scope (First Deliverable)

The MVP will support:
- Recipe import via URL with parsing of:
  - Title
  - Image
  - Ingredients (with quantities)
  - Steps
- A recipe library (searchable with tags / favorites)
- Weekly planner for exactly 3 dinner recipes
- Shopping list derived from planned meals minus inventory
- Light inventory based on “have / not have”
- Upload of fridge photos to help identify current stock

## 💡 Design Principles

- **Private & reliable** — no public recipe posts or sharing
- **Simple interactions** — minimal clicks to plan a week
- **Data driven suggestions** — use inventory and favorites to recommend meals
- **No unit conversions in MVP** — avoid complexity early
- **Clear affordances** — every action should feel intuitive
